# TicTacToe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in empty cells. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw. The game is simple yet strategic, requiring players to anticipate their opponent's moves while planning their own to achieve victory.
